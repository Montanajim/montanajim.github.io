## MySQL

MySQL is (as of March 2014) the world's second most[a] widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language.

 

The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned by Oracle Corporation.

## MariaDB

**MariaDB** is a community-developed, commercially supported [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) of the [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) (RDBMS), intended to remain [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) under the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License). Development is led by some of the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to concerns over its [acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover) by [Oracle Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation) in 2009.[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB#cite_note-6)

MariaDB is intended to maintain high compatibility with MySQL, with library binary parity and exact matching with MySQL [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) and commands, allowing it in many cases to function as drop-in replacement for MySQL. However, new features are diverging.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB#cite_note-7) It includes new [storage engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_engine) like [Aria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aria_(storage_engine)), [ColumnStore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniDB), and [MyRocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyRocks).

MariaDB is named after Widenius' younger daughter, Maria.
