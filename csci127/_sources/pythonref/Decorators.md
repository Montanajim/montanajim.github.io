# Decorators



Decorators are:

A design pattern that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or method without directly changing its code.
They are essentially functions that wrap other functions, adding extra functionality before, after, or around the original function's execution.

How they work:

Decorator function:

- Takes another function as an argument.
- Returns a modified version of the original function.

Applying a decorator:

- Use the @decorator_name syntax above a function definition.
- This is shorthand for function_name = decorator_name(function_name).





**Remember:**



- Decorators are functions that take another function as an argument and return a modified version of that function.
- They provide a powerful way to add functionality to existing functions without modifying their code directly.
- Use them to enhance code readability, maintainability, and reusability.

```py

listOfFunctionCalls = []

# log every function call
# in testing etc, this easily could be written
# to a log file

def log_function_call(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        result = func(*args)
        # print(f"Function '{func.__name__}' called with arguments {args} and {kwargs}. Returned {result}")
        xFunCall = (f"Function '{func.__name__}' called with arguments {args}. Returned {result}")
        listOfFunctionCalls.append(xFunCall)
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function_call
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

@log_function_call
def sub(x,y):
    return x - y

@log_function_call
def multiply(x,y):
    return x * y

def printFunctionsCalled():

    print("A list of functions called")
    for i in listOfFunctionCalls:
        print(i)

def main():

    print(add(5, 3))
