# Software Testing



## Software Testing Concepts

### Unit Testing

- **Definition:** Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation. These units could be functions, methods, or classes.
- **Purpose:** To verify that each unit works as expected and meets its specific requirements.
- Benefits:
  - Early detection of defects
  - Improved code quality
  - Increased code maintainability
  - Supports regression testing

### Integration Testing

- **Definition:** Integration testing combines multiple units or components to test their interactions and communication.
- **Purpose:** To verify that different parts of the software work together as expected.
- Benefits:
  - Identifies interface-related defects
  - Ensures data integrity and flow
  - Improves system stability

### Regression Testing

- **Definition:** Regression testing is the process of re-executing a subset of tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs correctly after changes have been made.
- **Purpose:** To prevent new code from introducing unintended side effects or breaking existing functionality.
- Benefits:
  - Maintains software quality over time
  - Reduces the risk of introducing new defects
  - Improves confidence in software changes

**In essence:**

- Unit testing focuses on the smallest parts of the code.
- Integration testing focuses on how those parts work together.
- Regression testing focuses on ensuring that previous functionality remains intact after changes.
