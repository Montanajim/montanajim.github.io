# Properties



**A Python property is a special construct that allows you to control access to an object attribute through methods, while still using dot notation as if it were a regular attribute.** This means you can perform additional logic, validation, or computations when getting or setting the attribute's value.



**Key points:**

- **Methods disguised as attributes:** Properties are essentially methods that act like attributes, making code more readable and intuitive.
- **Encapsulation:** They promote encapsulation by hiding the implementation details of how an attribute is accessed or modified.
- **Validation and control:** You can add validation or constraints to ensure data integrity, as well as perform side effects when the attribute is accessed or changed.
- **Readability:** They make code cleaner and more maintainable by avoiding explicit getter and setter methods.
