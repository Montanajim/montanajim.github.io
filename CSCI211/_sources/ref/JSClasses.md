# JavaScript Classes



JavaScript classes are a relatively new way to structure code using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. While JavaScript itself is prototype-based, classes act like syntactic sugar on top of that foundation, making it easier for programmers coming from other OOP languages like Java or C++ to adapt.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts in JavaScript classes:

- **Structure:** Classes are defined using the `class` keyword. Inside the class, you can define properties (like variables) and methods (like functions) that act on the data.
- **Constructors:** A constructor is a special method called with the `new` keyword when creating a new object (called an instance) from the class. It's typically used to initialize the object's properties.
- **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse.
- **Encapsulation (sort of):** While JavaScript doesn't have strict public/private access modifiers like some languages, you can simulate encapsulation using conventions like starting property names with underscores to discourage direct modification outside the class.

JavaScript introduced private members with the introduction of classes in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).

Here's a breakdown of private members in JavaScript:

**Declaring Private Members:**

- Private members are denoted using a hash (#) symbol before the property name.
- This creates a special kind of property that cannot be accessed directly outside of the class.

**Benefits of Private Members:**

- **Encapsulation:** Protects internal state of the object from unintentional modification.
- **Abstraction:** Exposes only necessary functionalities through public methods.
- **Reduced naming conflicts:** Protects private members from clashes with public names.

**Limitations:**

- **Accessibility:** While private members are enforced by JavaScript, a determined developer can still access them through trickery. However, it's generally not recommended practice.
- **Constructors:** Constructors themselves cannot be private in JavaScript.



Overall, JavaScript classes provide a familiar way to structure object-oriented code, making it easier to reason about complex applications and maintain larger codebases.

For the example below: 

The `Person` class has the following constructor parameters:

- `fname`: The first name of the person.
- `lname`: The last name of the person.
- `city`: The city where the person lives.

The `Person` class also has the following methods:

- `getfname`: A getter method that returns the value of the `fname` property.
- `setfname`: A setter method that sets the value of the `fname` property.
- `getlname`: A getter method that returns the value of the `lname` property.
- `setlname`: A setter method that sets the value of the `lname` property.
- `getcity`: A getter method that returns the value of the `city` property.
- `setcity`: A setter method that sets the value of the `city` property.
- `fullNameCity`: A method that returns the full name of the person and the city where they live.
