# CSCI 232 Data Structures and Algorithms


## Advanced Data Structures and Programming Techniques - Course Introduction

Welcome to the continuation of CSC 132! This course builds upon the foundational knowledge acquired in its prerequisite and dives deeper into advanced data structures and programming techniques, equipping students with the tools to tackle complex computational problems. Whether your goal is to enhance your programming expertise, refine algorithmic thinking, or understand the intricate mechanics behind software systems, this course provides the necessary framework to achieve those objectives.

The curriculum introduces a variety of data structures such as trees, balanced trees, graphs, dictionaries, hash tables, and heaps, exploring both their theoretical underpinnings and practical applications. Emphasis is placed on understanding the efficiency and correctness of algorithms, ensuring students can critically evaluate and implement solutions in real-world scenarios. A key component of the learning experience is the hands-on application of these concepts using Java, offering students the opportunity to reinforce their understanding through practical exercises and projects.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will have developed the skills to confidently explain and implement recursive algorithms, perform time-complexity analyses, and compare various sorting techniques. The course also introduces the implementation of basic Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as vectors, lists, sorted lists, stacks, and queues. Furthermore, students will gain in-depth knowledge of specialized structures and algorithms, including general trees, binary trees, balanced search trees, and hash tables.

A significant focus is placed on the evaluation and selection of appropriate data structures for solving specific problems. This critical thinking skill ensures that students are not only proficient in implementation but also capable of making informed design decisions in their programming endeavors.

This course sets the stage for advanced study and professional application in computer science, making it an essential step in your academic and career journey. Prepare to engage with challenging concepts, build robust programming skills, and expand your understanding of the dynamic field of computer science!
