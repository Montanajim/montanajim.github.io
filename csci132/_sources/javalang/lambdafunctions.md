```{admonition} Definition
**Lambda functions** are intended as a shorthand for defining functions that can come in handy to write concise code without wasting multiple lines defining a function. They are also known as anonymous functions, since they do not have a name unless assigned one. From *[Whatâ€™s in a Lambda?](https://towardsdatascience.com/whats-in-a-lambda-c8cdc67ff107)*
```



```{admonition} Definition
**Interface** - In its most common form, an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.  The programmer is then responsible for writing the functions
```



```{admonition} Note
In most other languages, lambda functions do not need an interface and can be written as just as an anonmyous function.  They all follow the same structure:

**( ) -> { }** 
```

// note that the interface can also be put in their own file
// note that a function is defined (which the programmer can name)
// in the interface.  The actual functin can then be written as 
// a global function or within a function.

interface InchtesToFeet{
    // Input is a double - inches
    // Output is a double executed by the function name "calculate"
    double calculate(double inches);
}

interface FtoC{
    // Input is a double - farh
    // Output is a double executed by the function name "calculate"
    double calculate(double farh);
    
}

interface GalaxayTip{
    // Input is nothing
    // Output is a string executed by the function name "calculate"   
    String run();
}

    // Input is two doubles
    // Output is a string executed by the function name "tabulate"      
    String tabulate(double num1,double num2);
