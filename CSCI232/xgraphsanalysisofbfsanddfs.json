Many computational problems across diverse domains, from network routing and social network analysis to state-space exploration in artificial intelligence, can be modeled using graphs. A common requirement when working with graphs is the ability to systematically visit or process each node. This process is known as graph traversal. Efficient graph traversal algorithms are essential for exploring graph structures and solving problems like finding paths, checking connectivity, identifying cycles, and analyzing network properties.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"NNDeTxmRM8"}],"key":"kHRcYSSbg7"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Two of the most foundational and widely used graph traversal algorithms are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).

BFS explores the graph level by level, expanding outwards from the source, whereas DFS explores as deeply as possible along one path before backtracking to explore alternatives. This report provides a detailed technical explanation and comparative analysis of BFS and DFS, examining their underlying mechanisms, core data structures (queues and stacks/recursion), strengths, weaknesses, and practical real-world applications.","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"WT2GsfFSsV"}],"key":"tJSbmB1emZ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"2.

The algorithm starts at a designated source vertex and visits all its immediate neighbors (nodes one edge away). Then, it visits all the neighbors of those nodes that haven’t been visited yet (nodes two edges away), and continues this process, level by level.
