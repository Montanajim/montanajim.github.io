| Feature                        | Binary Tree                                        | AVL Tree                                                | Red-Black Tree                                               |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Structure                      | Nodes have 0 or 2 children                         | Self-balancing, height difference between subtrees <= 1 | Self-balancing, specific color properties to maintain balance |
| Data Organization              | Can hold any type of data                          | Usually holds comparable data for efficient search      | Can hold any type of data                                    |
| Search Performance             | O(n) in worst case, O(log n) on average            | O(log n) guaranteed                                     | O(log n) guaranteed                                          |
| Insertion/Deletion Performance | O(n) in worst case, O(log n) on average            | O(log n) guaranteed, more complex operations            | O(log n) guaranteed, simpler operations than AVL             |
| Memory Usage                   | Minimum, only 2 pointers per node                  | Slightly higher than binary tree, stores balance factor | Slightly higher than binary tree, stores color information   |
| Applications                   | Simple data structures, expression trees           | Efficient search and sorting, databases                 | General purpose, good balance between performance and complexity |
| Pros                           | Simple to implement, efficient for small datasets  | Fast search and guaranteed balance                      | Faster insertions than AVL, simpler operations               |
| Cons                           | Can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance | More complex to implement than binary tree              | Not as strictly balanced as AVL trees, potentially impacting search performance in rare cases |
