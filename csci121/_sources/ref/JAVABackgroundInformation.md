# JAVA Background Information



## History

- **1991-1995:** Developed by James Gosling and a team at Sun Microsystems with the goal of creating a platform-independent language for consumer electronics. Originally named "Oak" but later changed to "Java" due to trademark issues.
- **Fall 1995:** Public release as part of Sun's "Green Project" to develop internet technologies. Gained traction due to its focus on web applets, small programs embedded in web pages that provided interactivity and animation.
- **Late 1990s:** Java's popularity exploded with the rise of the internet and e-commerce. Used to develop web applications, enterprise software, and mobile applications (through Java ME).
- **2000s:** Continued growth and diversification. Java EE (Enterprise Edition) emerged for complex enterprise applications, and Java SE (Standard Edition) became the foundation for desktop and embedded development. Open source implementations like OpenJDK gained momentum.
- **2010:** Oracle acquires Sun Microsystems, gaining control of Java. The acquisition sparked concerns about the language's future and open source development.
- **2010s-Present:** Java remains a dominant force in enterprise and embedded development, but faces competition from newer languages like Python and JavaScript. Oracle faces ongoing challenges related to licensing and open source governance.



**Key Points to Remember:**

- Java's initial focus on web applets was crucial for its early adoption.
- The language's platform *independence* and object-oriented design contributed to its widespread use.
- Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems had a significant impact on the Java ecosystem.
- Java continues to evolve but faces competition from newer languages.
