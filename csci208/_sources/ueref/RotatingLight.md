# Rotating Light

## Viewport Items Needed

* Spotlight - need to point it in the desired direction
* Need an integer variable *RotateZ* . This represents the angle / direction the spotlight is pointing.



```{Note}
Note the Branch Widget. This is need to see if the rotation is past 360 degrees. If so, then the RotateZ variable is set back to 0.
```
