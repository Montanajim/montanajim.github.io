# Events



In MySQL, an event is a task that is executed according to a schedule. Events can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as sending emails, running reports, or backing up databases.

To create an event, you use the `CREATE EVENT` statement. The syntax for the `CREATE EVENT` statement is as follows:

```sql
CREATE EVENT event_name
ON SCHEDULE schedule
DO statement;
```

The `event_name` is the name of the event. The `schedule` is a expression that defines when the event will be executed. The `statement` is the SQL statement that will be executed when the event is triggered.

For example, the following statement creates an event called `backup_database` that will back up the `mydb` database every day at 2am:

```sql
CREATE EVENT backup_database
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 DAY
DO BACKUP DATABASE mydb;
```

Once you have created an event, you can use the `SHOW EVENTS` statement to view the event's properties. You can also use the `START EVENT` statement to start the event, the `STOP EVENT` statement to stop the event, and the `DROP EVENT` statement to delete the event.

Events are a powerful tool for automating tasks in MySQL. They can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as sending emails, running reports, or backing up databases.
