# Static Mesh Actors

https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/static-mesh-actors-in-unreal-engine/



The **Static Mesh Actor** is a simple type of Actor that displays a 3D mesh in the Level. Although the name implies that the Actor is static (or unable to move), the "static" refers to the type of mesh used rather than the Actor's ability to move. A mesh is **static** if its geometry does not change. Otherwise, the Actor itself can be moved or changed in other ways during play.

Static Mesh Actors are commonly used to create game worlds or other types of environments.

Unreal Engine includes the following default Static Mesh Actors:

- Cube
- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Cone
- Plane

In addition to these, you can import your own Static Mesh Actors that were created in other 3D applications.
