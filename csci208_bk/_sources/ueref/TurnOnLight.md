> ## Triggering Events
>
> Triggers are used to activate events placed inside of the __Level Blueprint__. There are several different types of events that a Trigger can activate. The main ones happen in response to some type of collision with another object, such as something hitting or overlapping with the Trigger, or in response to input from the player.
>
> With the Trigger selected in the **Viewport**:
>
> - **Right-click** in the **Level Blueprint Event Graph** and choose one of the events under **Add Event for [Trigger Actor Name]**.
