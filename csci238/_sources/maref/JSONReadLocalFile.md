# JSON  - Read  Local JSON File

## Overview

This Flutter program is a simple mobile application that loads and displays a list of movies from a local JSON file (`movies_array.json`). Here’s a brief overview:

1. **Main Structure**: 
   - The app starts with a main widget (`MyApp`), which initializes the `Homepage` widget.

2. **Homepage Widget**:
   - It contains the main functionality, managing the state of the app.
   - It has a list called `_movies` to store the data fetched from the JSON file.
   - A boolean variable, `buttonVisible`, controls the visibility of a button that loads the JSON data.

3. **Loading JSON Data**:
   - The `readJson()` function is used to read the contents of the JSON file and update the `_movies` list.
   - It uses `setState()` to refresh the UI, displaying the loaded movies and hiding the "Load Data" button.

4. **User Interface**:
   - The UI consists of an app bar, a "Load Data" button, and a list view to display movie data.
   - The movies are displayed using `ListView.builder()`, which generates a list of `Card` widgets, each representing a movie.
   

This app demonstrates how to read local JSON data, manage state, and dynamically update the UI in a Flutter app.
